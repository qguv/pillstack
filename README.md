# pillstack

a remix of https://www.printables.com/model/116168-stackable-supplement-containers.

changes from the original:

- textured exterior

## building

run `ninja` or `openscad -o pillstack.3mf pillstack.scad`

## animation

some animations are included at the beginning of pillstack.scad. you can uncomment them (one at a time) to view them. from the OpenSCAD GUI, select View â†’ Animate, then set FPS to 30 and Steps to 360

note: this seems to prevent OpenSCAD from automatically updating the preview when the source changes
